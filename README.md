# React Server-Side-Rendering Example

## About

A Server-Side-Rendering E-commerce that works Offline.

## Goals

I wanted to make a Isomorphic application, but didn't know how to make one
so I endend making a Server-Side-Rendering Application using ONLY 
React and React-Router.
Also I wanted to use the useConnect and useReducer hooks and using 
webpack instead of create-react-app.

## Requirements

npm, webpack globally installed

## Quickstart

run ``npm install``

run ``webpack``

run ``npm run start``

## Errors

It has this error in webpack that says it doesn't find some modules
but still builds. So idk.
